Ideas for a SimCity (Simulation) type game, in JS and using PS5.js for the graphics.

Using JavaScript, and P5.js (http://p5js.org) to create a simcity type simulation game.
Allow the user to build properties, property type, and let it take on a life of it's own.

## What I Learnt
* Ps5.js graphics, DOM intergration.
* Multi-dimensional array object manipulation and displaying into graphical grid interface.
